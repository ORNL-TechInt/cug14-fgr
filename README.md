# CUG14 FGR paper repo

Here is the current outline along with an arbitratily designated person:

  * Abstract - Already written
  * Background - Sarp
  * Motivation - Dustin, Jason, Matt
  * Goals - Dustin, Jason, Matt
  * Placement - Matt
  * FGR - Devesh and Feiyi

The sections are stored in the 'sections' subfolder.  Feel free to break the
sections into multiple file if that makes editing easier.

Please try to keep to 80 columns.  If you are using vim, the hints at the
bottom should put you in the appropriate mode.  If possible, try to avoid
having small edits re-linebreak an entire paragraph.

On RHEL6, you need the package 'texlive-latex'. On a Mac, you can download
mactex which includes lots of useful tools. If you have any problems getting
the paper to compile, do not hesitate to send a message to the authors list
for help.
