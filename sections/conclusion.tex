\section{Conclusion}

The evolution of compute platforms at Oak Ridge National Laboratory has
necessitated unique designs for the storage systems that support them.  Lessons
learned from the deployment and operation of the Spider~I file system led to
the development of fine-grained routing to improve throughput and minimize
congestion.  The Spider~II system was designed and built with fine-grained
routing as a core component.  To support this new file system, the quantity of
I/O routers in Titan was increased and they were carefully placed to minimize
congestion.  A new fine-grained routing mechanism was created that was tailored
specifically to the two systems.
