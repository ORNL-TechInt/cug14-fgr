\section{Issues}

The I/O router placement attempts to address the issue of traffic routing and
imbalance at system level. The route selection algorithm aims to minimize hops
and mitigate contention between the compute clients and I/O routers. However,
two issues remain evident. First of which is, this mitigation and balancing
strategy extends only to I/O routers, it is \emph{not} a end-to-end complete
solution. Secondly, the benefits of such placement strategy can only be
full realized when the whole system is under the control such that only
selected clients perform I/O on pre-determined targets. 

Due to aforementioned limitations, we have been working on a end-to-end,
balanced data placement strategy to complement the backend fine grain routing
algorithm. The primary goal is to extend the balancing beyond I/O routers and
into the final destination. This work remains a work in progress though.
