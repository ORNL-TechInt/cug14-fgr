\section{Placement}

The placement of the I/O routers in a large 3D torus can have an enormous impact
on the traffic patterns and congestions characteristics present in the system.

\subsection{Topological Concerns}

Changes SeaStar to Gemini

Gemini has differing bandwidth characteristics

Minimize torus congestion

GPUs has increased load on network

Congestion avoidance

\subsection{Physical Constraints}

Doubling Routers

Ensure full routability to boot from both ends

Balance router usage

Minimize Pinging

Swizzle to spread Gemini load
