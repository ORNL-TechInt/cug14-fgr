\section{Abstract}

The Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) introduced the concept of
fine-grained routing in 2008 to improve I/O performance between the Jaguar
supercomputer and Spider, the center-wide Lustre file system. Fine-grained
routing organizes I/O paths to minimize congestion. Jaguar has since been
upgraded to Titan, providing more than a ten-fold improvement in peak
performance. To support the centerâ€™s increased computational capacity and I/O
demand, the Spider file system has been replaced with Spider II. Building on
the lessons learned from Spider, an improved method for placing LNET routers
was developed and implemented for Spider II. The fine-grained routing scripts
and configuration have been updated to provide additional optimizations and
better match the system setup. This paper presents a brief history of
fine-grained routing at OLCF, an introduction to the architectures of Titan and
Spider II, methods for placing routers in Titan, and details about the
fine-grained routing configuration.
